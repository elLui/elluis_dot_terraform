elluis-blog ingrastructure Terraform build - 

:: intended to be the main deployment build upon completion of blog-project ::

    intent  : build an AWS infrastructure that supports a hobby project blog website
    
    tools   :
        build_resources     :   Terraform - Ansible - AWSCLI - tbd 
                                # ( depending on final deployment schema - may decide to eventually incorporate Docker as our final deployment container ie.

        ******************* about versions *******************
        
        all created resources elluis_* will be denoted as elluis_v*_(*(developement/staging/production))_(*(ie. internet_gateway, public_subnet))
            example: elluis_v1.2_production_internet_gateway))
            
        versions: each version of this project will be seperated into its own repository
            - reason: due such significant variances for each environment -- environments along with summary of environment follow:
            
               environments:
                   
                   production: ?? not yet implemented !! production in this sense - best of what I have - mainly without comments to reduce clutter !! 
                   (may never be implemented (rofl))
                        
                   staging: construction of production environment
                        
                   developement: low cost server environment
                    
                        
            
        *************

        notes: Terraform module tag system is used to for several purposes:
                    * It will dynamically add the 'Name' tag to each resource built ie tag = { Name = "elluis_codes_us-east-2a_" }

                  tags are used to implement the following properties during terraform construction:
                        vpc name
                        create one private && public subnet in each available availability zone according to selected region
                        name each subnet as follows: (vpc), (region+availability zone), (tag designating public or private subnet)
                        dynamically assign ip address ranges to given subnets
                        create one private and public route table in vpc
                        name each route table following explained conventions

                    wanted to catch up on some documentation before focusing on my plain developer setup really want to delve back into the front end

                    setup a todoist project reminder == 12.28.20 to continue work on this section
